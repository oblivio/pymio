# pymio v0.1

**pymio** is a tool that allows users to easily create a list of
videos from youtube.com - much like a playlist. Once the list of
videos is complete - they can click the download button - which
will download the .mp3 version of the video.

**DISCLAIMER**
pymio is an experiment provided  **AS IS** - this idea came out of a personal
need - and decided to make it open source in
case it is someday useful to someone. In it's current state -
it is **NOT** ready to be used in a production environment.
